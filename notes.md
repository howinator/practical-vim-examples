# Chapter 1

vim is designed for repetition. 

## Keystrokes

- `>G` will increase indentation from this line to the end of the file
- vim will record every keystroke from when we enter insert mode until we switch back to insert mode.
- `A` will start append at the end of the line.
- ';' will repeat the last f, F, t, or T command.
  - `,` will repeat the last f, F, t, or T command in the opposite direction.
- '*' will search for the word under the cursor.
- 'c' accepts a motion and will delete everything in the motion and go into insert mode.
